# LiZRD - Library for Zipping through Research Designs

Name suggestions are welcome.

## Installing requirements

Simple `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` should work. Be sure to use a virtualenv.

## Usage
Run a single local experiment with `python3 -m lizrd.train.bert_train TESTING`. The flag `TESTING` will disable ClearML, and run a smaller model.
If you use ClearML, you must have clearml config in your home directory. Note that if you don't use srun.sbatch on entropy, you won't have access to GPU.

To run a single experiment on entropy, write your shell script based on `run_train.sh`, and run it either by:
`srun --partition=common --qos=24gpu7d --gres=gpu:titanv:1 run_time.sh`
or `sbatch lizrd/scripts/run_train.sh`.

To run multiple experiment, modify gen_run_trains.py and run:
`python3 -m lizrd.scripts.gen_run_trains.py --prefix=SWPB --real --sleep=70`

To just generate configs without scheduling jobs, run:
`python3 -m lizrd.scripts.gen_run_trains.py --prefix=SWP --test --sleep=0`

## Code description

By directories:
* `lizrd` - main library
  * `core` - core code
    * `bert.py` - main layers, bert model
      * in the future, this should be split into layers, models, and some of it should be moved to research
    * `misc.py` - miscellanous functions
    * `nn.py` - base Module layer, and classes from torch.nn
  * `datasets` - data processing
    * `wikibookdata.py` - data processing of standard BERT training datasets
  * `scripts` - scripts for running experiments
    * `gen_run_trains.py` - generate shell scripts for running experiments
    * `run_train.sh` - shell script for running a single experiment
  * `support` - support code
    * `ash.py` - Assert Shapes on tensors
    * `metrics.py` - logging metrics during training
    * `profile.py` - for profiling models and layers
    * `test_utils.py` - testing utilities
  * `train` - training code
    * `bert_train.py` - main training script
* `research` - experimental code
    * `archived_code` - probably should be removed
    * `initialization` - research on better initialization scheme
    * `timing` - tests with profiling the main code
    * `conditional` - research on conditional computation (to be split from `core`)
