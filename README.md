# llm-random
We are LLM-Random, a research group at [IDEAS NCBR](https://ideas-ncbr.pl/en/) (Warsaw, Poland). We develop this repo and use it to conduct research. To learn more about us and our research, check out our blog, [llm-random.github.io](https://llm-random.github.io/).

## Development (WIP)
### Getting started
In the root directory run `./start-dev.sh`. This will create a virtual environment, install requirements and set up git hooks.

## Running Experiments (WIP)

### Experiments config
Use the baseline configuration as a template, which is in `configs/test/test_baseline.yaml`. Based on this template, create a new experiment config and put it in `lizrd/scripts/run_configs`.

### Running Locally
`python -m lizrd.scripts.grid path/to/config`

### Running Remotely
`bash lizrd/scripts/run_exp_remotely.sh <remote_cluster_name> lizrd/scripts/run_configs/<your_config>`
