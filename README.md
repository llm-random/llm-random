# llm-random


## Getting started
In root directory run `./start-dev.sh`. This will create a virtual environment, install requirements and setup git hooks.


## Experiments config
Use the baseline configuration as a template, which is in `research/conditional/train/configs/test/test_baseline.yaml`. Based on this template, create a new experiment config and put it in `lizrd/scripts/run_configs`.

## Run exeperiment

### Locally
`python -m lizrd.scripts.grid path/to/config`

### Remotely
`bash lizrd/scripts/run_exp_remotely.sh <remote_cluster_name> lizrd/scripts/run_configs/<your_config>`

## Code description

By directories:
* `lizrd` - main library
  * `core` - core code
    * `bert.py` - main layers, bert model
      * in the future, this should be split into layers, models, and some of it should be moved to research
    * `misc.py` - miscellanous functions
    * `nn.py` - base Module layer, and classes from torch.nn
  * `datasets` - data processing
    * `wikibookdata.py` - data processing of standard BERT training datasets
  * `scripts` - scripts for running experiments
    * `gen_run_trains.py` - generate shell scripts for running experiments
    * `run_train.sh` - shell script for running a single experiment
  * `support` - support code
    * `ash.py` - Assert Shapes on tensors
    * `metrics.py` - logging metrics during training
    * `profile.py` - for profiling models and layers
    * `test_utils.py` - testing utilities
  * `train` - training code
    * `bert_train.py` - main training script
* `research` - experimental code
    * `archived_code` - probably should be removed
    * `initialization` - research on better initialization scheme
    * `timing` - tests with profiling the main code
    * `conditional` - research on conditional computation (to be split from `core`)
    * `nonlinearities` - research on smaller neurons
    * `reinitialization` - research on recycling neurons
